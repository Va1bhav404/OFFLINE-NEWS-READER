📱 Offline News Reader — PWA

A fast, offline-first news reading web app built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript, Service Workers, and IndexedDB.
The app fetches real headlines when the user is online, caches them locally, and allows full offline reading.

⭐ Features
🔵 1. Online Mode (Live News)

Detects when the user is connected to the internet.
Fetches fresh news articles from the NewsData.io API.
Saves articles into IndexedDB for offline use.
Marks these new articles as 🟢 Fresh.


🔴 2. Offline Mode (Cached News)

When WiFi is off, the app:
Does NOT call the API
Instantly loads articles stored in the local database
Previously fetched fresh articles become 🟡 Stale (Cached).


⚙️ 3. Service Worker (PWA)

App loads instantly even with 0 internet.
Caches the entire app shell:
HTML
CSS
JS



🗄️ 4. IndexedDB Storage

Stores:
Article metadata (title, snippet, time cached)
Article content (if available)
Sync batch number (for freshness badges)



🌀 5. Manual Sync Button
User taps Sync, and:
If online → fetch new articles + mark fresh
If offline → show a “No internet” message



| Technology           | Purpose                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **HTML5**            | Structure              |
| **Tailwind CSS**     | UI & responsive design |
| **JavaScript (ES6)** | App logic              |
| **NewsData.io API**  | Live news source       |
| **IndexedDB**        | Offline storage        |
| **Service Worker**   | PWA & offline caching  |
| **Manifest.json**    | Installation support   |



📲 How It Works (Simple Explanation)
▶️ 1. When the user opens the app:
Service Worker loads cached UI instantly.


🌐 2. If WiFi is ON:

App fetches news from NewsData API
Saves articles into IndexedDB
Marks these as Fresh
Older articles become Stale


❌ 3. If WiFi is OFF:

No API is called
Cached articles are loaded immediately
The app works perfectly offline


🧪 Demo Flow (for Teachers)

Open app with WiFi ON → click Sync → Fresh news appear

Turn WiFi OFF → refresh → cached news still load (offline proof)

Turn WiFi ON → click Sync again → newer Fresh news appear

This demonstrates:

Offline-first architecture

Data persistence

Service worker caching

Database usage

Sync lifecycle

🚀 Installation (Developer Setup)
1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/offline-news-reader.git
cd offline-news-reader

2. Install dependencies (for local CORS proxy)
npm install

3. Start local proxy
node proxy.js

Proxy runs at:
http://localhost:3000/news



4. Start Live Server for index.html
Right-click index.html
Select Open with Live Server



🧩 Folder Structure
offline-news-reader/
│── index.html
│── proxy.js                (CORS bypass)
│── package.json
│── README.md
│── /icons                  (PWA icons)
└── /assets                 (images if any)


📌 API Used:


Example request (via proxy):
http://localhost:3000/news



(Stretch Goal):
API



🏁 Final Note:
This project shows strong understanding of:
Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
IndexedDB
Service Workers
Offline caching strategy
Live API integration
JavaScript async workflow
